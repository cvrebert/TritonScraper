TritonScraper is a `web scraper <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping>`_ for the `University of California, San Diego (UCSD) <http://ucsd.edu>`_'s `Schedule of Classes <https://www-act.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/tritonlink.pl/2/students/academic/classes/schedule_of_classes.pl>`_ on `TritonLink`_, written in `Python <http://python.org>`_. That is, it is a library for programmatically extracting scheduling and enrollment information on UCSD classes.

It is mostly functional and fairly documented, but probably not ready for public consumption just yet.

TritonScraper could be used to e.g. write a better, third-party UCSD course signup planning website/webapp in Python.
